1. Introduction

MoSync Reload is a tool for rapid development of mobile applications in 
HTML5 and JavaScript for iOS, Android and Windows Phone.

You can access native features such as camera, SMS, file system and sensors 
and create interfaces using real, native UI controls.

Reload lets you edit code on your PC, Mac or Linux machine and then instantly 
see the result of your changes on any number of devices or emulators. It’s just 
like pressing “reload” in  a browser, but for native mobile apps!


2. Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
You need a working installation of Node.js 0.6 or newer to use Reload!
